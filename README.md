# Milestone 1 – Web Evolution

This repository contains a six-page website built with semantic HTML and a single external CSS file.

## Pages
- `index.html` – cover page and table of contents (cards in a CSS **Grid**).
- `http-history.html` – origin story of HTTP and the Web.
- `http-versions.html` – comparison **table** of HTTP 0.9, 1.0, 1.1, 2, 3.
- `key-concepts.html` – 7 key concepts (URLs, methods, status codes, headers, caching, TLS, QUIC).
- `references.html` – links/citations.
- `about.html` – author and project context.

## CSS
- `styles.css` – the only stylesheet, using **Flexbox** for the main nav and **Grid** for the home cards.
- Demonstrates element, class, and **#id** selectors, plus `:hover` and focus-visible UX.

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a new public repo (e.g., `it3203-m1`).  
2. Upload the contents of the `site/` folder (not the ZIP itself).  
3. Go to **Settings → Pages** → set **Branch: main / root** → Save.  
4. Your site will deploy at: `https://github.com/idcceejay/it3203-m1`

**Live URL (fill in after deploy):** https://github.com/idcceejay/it3203-m1

## Validation Checklist
- [ ] All nav links work across pages.
- [ ] W3C HTML validator: no errors, minimal warnings.
- [ ] Replace “Your Name” in footer and CSS header.
- [ ] Images have appropriate `alt` text (decorative images use empty alt).
